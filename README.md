# Big Mart Sale Prediction Project

This project is focused on predicting sales at Big Mart stores based on various features related to products and stores. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the total sales for each product at a particular store.

# Project Structure
The project contains the following files and resources:
1.	Project Report (PDF): A detailed report documenting the entire process of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, results, and conclusion.
2.	Project Report Format (Word): The project report template in Word format, outlining the structure used to create the final report.
3.	Jupyter Notebook (Source Code): This file contains the entire project code implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
4.	HTML Version of Jupyter Notebook: A web-friendly version of the Jupyter Notebook that can be opened directly in a browser for easy viewing.
5.	Kaggle Dataset: The dataset used for this project, which consists of:
o	Train Data: The training dataset used to train the machine learning models.
o	Test Data: The testing dataset used to evaluate the model's performance.

# Project Overview
The Big Mart Sales Prediction project is aimed at using historical sales data to predict future sales for a variety of products across different Big Mart stores. The dataset contains product attributes, store details, and historical sales data.

# Key Steps in the Project:
1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the data to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in feature selection and model building.
3.	Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing data to improve the model’s performance.
4.	Prediction: Using the final model to predict sales on the test dataset and generating insights for improving store operations.



# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is split into two parts:
•	Train Data: Contains features like Item Identifier, Item Weight, Item Visibility, Item Type, Outlet Type, and Outlet Sales.
•	Test Data: Similar to the train data but without the Outlet Sales column, which is the target variable we aim to predict.


# How to Use
•	Step 1: Clone this repository to your local machine.
•	Step 2: Open the Jupyter Notebook in your Python environment.
•	Step 3: Run the notebook to follow the end-to-end process from data cleaning to model evaluation.
•	Step 4: Review the results and insights from the predictions.
